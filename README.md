# 🧠 BERT News Classifier

**Fine-tune. Visualize. Deploy.**
A complete pipeline for news article classification using BERT-based models — built for clarity, scalability, and real-world robustness.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

A fully modular NLP pipeline that:

* 📊 Preprocesses and balances multiclass news data
* 🧩 Tokenizes with `bert-base-uncased` (or lighter variants)
* 🔧 Fine-tunes BERT/DistilBERT for **single- or multi-label** classification
* 🧠 Visualizes **attention weights** to open the black box
* 🛡️ Includes tools for **domain adaptation**, **error analysis**, and **adversarial testing**
* 📦 Supports lightweight deployment via **ONNX**, **quantization**, and **API wrappers**

---

## 🛠️ Features

* ✅ **4-class classification** (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) — single or multi-label
* 🔍 Built-in **attention viz** with BertViz & Captum
* 🔁 **Curriculum fine-tuning** for domain shift
* ⚙️ Auto-scheduling, dropout tuning, and hyperparam search via Optuna
* ⚡ DistilBERT/ONNX = fast inference, low latency
* 🧪 Tested with TextAttack for robustness against noise/adversarial edits
* 📈 Output: precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, and interpretability plots

---

## 📦 Example Use Cases

* Real-time news tagging in content platforms
* Misinformation detection & content moderation
* Topic-aware newsfeeds
* Research into BERT attention and interpretability

---

## 🧱 Stack

* `transformers` (HuggingFace)
* `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`
* `Optuna`, `TextAttack`, `BertViz`, `Captum`
* Optional: `FastAPI`, `Docker`, `ONNX` for deployment

---

## 📌 Project Goals

This repo is built for **practical ML workflows** that need to:

1. Handle real-world data quirks (imbalance, noise, multi-topic overlap)
2. Deploy efficiently (sub-100ms latency on CPU)
3. Explain predictions with visuals that make sense

---

## 🧪 Bonus

Includes edge-case handling for:

* Articles longer than 512 tokens (hierarchical encoding / Longformer)
* Underrepresented classes (focal loss, augmentation)
* Multi-label logic for fuzzy real-world news categories

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

If you're building an intelligent news platform — or want to *actually understand* what BERT is paying attention to — this repo’s your launchpad.
